      "Many remedies are suggested for the avoidance of worry and mental\n",
      "overstrain by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear\n",
      "exceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large\n",
      "scale.  Some advise exercise, and others, repose.  Some counsel travel,\n",
      "and others, retreat.  Some praise solitude, and others, gaiety.  No\n",
      "doubt all these may play their part according to the individual\n",
      "temperament.  But the element which is constant and common in all of\n",
      "them is Change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Change is the master key.  A man can wear out a particular part of his\n",
      "mind by continually using it and tiring it, just in the same way as he\n",
      "can wear out the elbows of his coat.  There is, however, this\n",
      "difference between the living cells of the brain and inanimate\n",
      "articles: one cannot mend the frayed elbows of a coat by rubbing the\n",
      "sleeves or shoulders; but the tired parts of the mind can be rested and\n",
      "strengthened, not merely by rest, but by using other parts.  It is not\n",
      "enough merely to switch off the lights which play upon the main and\n",
      "ordinary field of interest; a new field of interest must be\n",
      "illuminated.  It is no use saying to the tired 'mental muscles'--if one\n",
      "may coin such an expression--I will give you a good rest,' 'I will go\n",
      "for a long walk,' or 'I will lie down and think of nothing.'  The mind\n",
      "keeps busy just the same.  If it has been weighing and measuring, it\n",
      "goes on weighing and measuring.  If it has been worrying, it goes on\n",
      "worrying.  It is only when new cells are called into activity, when new\n",
      "stars become the lords of the ascendant, that relief, repose,\n",
      "refreshment are afforded.\n",
      "\n",
      "A gifted American psychologist has said, 'Worry is a spasm of the\n",
      "emotion; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.'\n",
      "It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition.  The stronger\n",
      "the will, the more futile the task.  One can only gently insinuate\n",
      "something else into its convulsive grasp.  And if this something else\n",
      "is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the illumination of\n",
      "another field of interest, gradually, and often quite swiftly, the old\n",
      "undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a\n",
      "policy of first importance to a public man.  But this is not a business\n",
      "that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command\n",
      "of the will.  The growth of alternative mental interests is a long\n",
      "process.  The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good\n",
      "ground; they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to\n",
      "be at hand when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or\n",
      "three hobbies, and they must all be real.  It is no use starting late\n",
      "in life to say: 'I will take an interest in this or that.'  Such an\n",
      "attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort.  A man may acquire\n",
      "great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet\n",
      "hardly get any benefit or relief.  It is no use doing what you like;\n",
      "you have got to like what you do.  Broadly speaking, human beings may\n",
      "be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, those who\n",
      "are worried to death, and those who are bored to death.  It is no use\n",
      "offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week's sweat and\n",
      "effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on\n",
      "Saturday afternoon.  It is no use inviting the politician or the\n",
      "professional or business man, who has been working or worrying about\n",
      "serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at\n",
      "the week-end.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who\n",
      "can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of\n",
      "desire--for them a new pleasure, a new excitement is only an additional\n",
      "satiation.  In vain they rush frantically round from place to place,\n",
      "trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion.  For\n",
      "them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are\n",
      "divided into two classes: first, those whose work is work and whose\n",
      "pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are\n",
      "one.  Of these the former are the majority.  They have their\n",
      "compensations.  The long hours in the office or the factory bring with\n",
      "them, as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, but a keen\n",
      "appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms.  But\n",
      "Fortune's favoured children belong to the second class.  Their life is\n",
      "a natural harmony.  For them the working hours are never long enough.\n",
      "Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they come are grudged\n",
      "as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation.  Yet to both\n",
      "classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere,\n",
      "of a diversion of effort, is essential.  Indeed, it may well be that\n",
      "those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of\n",
      "banishing it at intervals from their minds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common form of diversion is reading.  In that vast and varied\n",
      "field millions find their mental comfort.  Nothing makes a man more\n",
      "reverent than a library.  'A few books,' which was Lord Morley's\n",
      "definition of anything under five thousand, may give a sense of comfort\n",
      "and even of complacency.  But a day in a library, even of modest\n",
      "dimensions, quickly dispels these illusory sensations.  As you browse\n",
      "about, taking down book after book from the shelves and contemplating\n",
      "the vast, infinitely varied store of knowledge and wisdom which the\n",
      "human race has accumulated and preserved, pride, even in its most\n",
      "innocent forms, is chased from the heart by feelings of awe not\n",
      "untinged with sadness.  As one surveys the mighty array of sages,\n",
      "saints, historians, scientists, poets and philosophers whose treasures\n",
      "one will never be able to admire--still less enjoy--the brief tenure of\n",
      "our existence here dominates mind and spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of all the wonderful tales that have been told, and well told,\n",
      "which you will never know.  Think of all the searching inquiries into\n",
      "matters of great consequence which you will never pursue.  Think of all\n",
      "the delighting or disturbing ideas that you will never share.  Think of\n",
      "the mighty labours which have been accomplished for your service, but\n",
      "of which you will never reap the harvest.  But from this melancholy\n",
      "there also comes a calm.  The bitter sweets of a pious despair melt\n",
      "into an agreeable sense of compulsory resignation from which we turn\n",
      "with renewed zest to the lighter vanities of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What shall I do with all my books?' was the question; and the answer,\n",
      "'Read them,' sobered the questioner.  But if you cannot read them, at\n",
      "any rate handle them and, as it were, fondle them.  Peer into them.\n",
      "Let them fall open where they will.  Read on from the first sentence\n",
      "that arrests the eye.  Then turn to another.  Make a voyage of\n",
      "discovery, taking soundings of uncharted seas.  Set them back on their\n",
      "shelves with your own hands.  Arrange them on your own plan, so that if\n",
      "you do not know what is in them, you at least know where they are.  If\n",
      "they cannot be your friends, let them at any rate be your\n",
      "acquaintances.  If they cannot enter the circle of your life, do not\n",
      "deny them at least a nod of recognition.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a mistake to read too many good books when quite young.  A man\n",
      "once told me that he had read all the books that mattered.\n",
      "Cross-questioned, he appeared to have read a great many, but they\n",
      "seemed to have made only a slight impression.  How many had he\n",
      "understood?  How many had entered into his mental composition?  How\n",
      "many had been hammered on the anvils of his mind, and afterwards ranged\n",
      "in an armoury of bright weapons ready to hand?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a great pity to read a book too soon in life.  The first\n",
      "impression is the one that counts; and if it is a slight one, it may be\n",
      "all that can be hoped for.  A later and second perusal may recoil from\n",
      "a surface already hardened by premature contact.  Young people should\n",
      "be careful in their reading, as old people in eating their food.  They\n",
      "should not eat too much.  They should chew it well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since change is an essential element in diversion of all kinds, it is\n",
      "naturally more restful and refreshing to read in a different language\n",
      "from that in which one's ordinary daily work is done.  To have a second\n",
      "language at your disposal, even if you only know it enough to read it\n",
      "with pleasure, is a sensible advantage.  Our educationists are too\n",
      "often anxious to teach children so many different languages that they\n",
      "never get far enough in any one to derive any use or enjoyment from\n",
      "their study.  The boy learns enough Latin to detest it; enough Greek to\n",
      "pass an examination; enough French to get from Calais to Paris; enough\n",
      "German to exhibit a diploma; enough Spanish or Italian to tell which is\n",
      "which; but not enough of any to secure the enormous boon of access to a\n",
      "second literature.  Choose well, choose wisely, and choose one.\n",
      "Concentrate upon that one.  Do not be content until you find yourself\n",
      "reading in it with real enjoyment.  The process of reading for pleasure\n",
      "in another language rests the mental muscles; it enlivens the mind by a\n",
      "different sequence and emphasis of ideas.  The mere form of speech\n",
      "excites the activity of separate brain-cells, relieving in the most\n",
      "effective manner the fatigue of those in hackneyed use.  One may\n",
      "imagine that a man who blew the trumpet for his living would be glad to\n",
      "play the violin for his amusement.  So it is with reading in another\n",
      "language than your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But reading and book-love in all their forms suffer from one serious\n",
      "defect: they are too nearly akin to the ordinary daily round of the\n",
      "brain-worker to give that element of change and contrast essential to\n",
      "real relief.  To restore psychic equilibrium we should call into use\n",
      "those parts of the mind which direct both eye and hand.  Many men have\n",
      "found great advantage in practising a handicraft for pleasure.\n",
      "Joinery, chemistry, book-binding, even brick-laying--if one were\n",
      "interested in them and skilful at them--would give a real relief to the\n",
      "over-tired brain.  But, best of all and easiest to procure are\n",
      "sketching and painting in all their forms.  I consider myself very\n",
      "lucky that late in life I have been able to develop this new taste and\n",
      "pastime.  Painting came to my rescue in a most trying time, and I shall\n",
      "venture in the pages that follow to express the gratitude I feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Painting is a companion with whom one may hope to walk a great part of\n",
      "life's journey,\n",

      "One by one the more vigorous sports and exacting games fall away.\n",
      "Exceptional exertions are purchased only by a more pronounced and more\n",
      "prolonged fatigue.  Muscles may relax, and feet and hands slow down;\n",
      "the nerve of youth and manhood may become less trusty.  But painting is\n",
      "a friend who makes no undue demands, excites to no exhausting pursuits,\n",
      "keeps faithful pace even with feeble steps, and holds her canvas as a\n",
      "screen between us and the envious eyes of Time or the surly advance of\n",
      "Decrepitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy are the painters, for they shall not be lonely.  Light and\n",
      "colour, peace and hope, will keep them company to the end, or almost to\n",
      "the end, of the day.\n",

      "To have reached the age of forty without ever handling a brush or\n",
      "fiddling with a pencil, to have regarded with mature eye the painting\n",
      "of pictures of any kind as a mystery, to have stood agape before the\n",
      "chalk of the pavement artist, and then suddenly to find oneself plunged\n",
      "in the middle of a new and intense form of interest and action with\n",
      "paints and palettes and canvases, and not to be discouraged by results,\n",
      "is an astonishing and enriching experience.  I hope it may be shared by\n",
      "others.  I should be glad if these lines induced others to try the\n",
      "experiment which I have tried, and if some at least were to find\n",
      "themselves dowered with an absorbing new amusement delightful to\n",
      "themselves, and at any rate not violently harmful to man or beast.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this is modest enough: because there is no subject on which I\n",
      "feel more humble or yet at the same time more natural.  I do not\n",
      "presume to explain how to paint, but only how to get enjoyment.  Do not\n",
      "turn the superior eye of critical passivity upon these efforts.  Buy a\n",
      "paint-box and have a try.  If you need something to occupy your\n",
      "leisure, to divert your mind from the daily round, to illuminate your\n",
      "holidays, do not be too ready to believe that you cannot find what you\n",
      "want here.  Even at the advanced age of forty!  It would be a sad pity\n",
      "to shuffle or scramble along through one's playtime with golf and\n",

      "depend partly upon the frequency with which these points are found on\n",
      "any given area of the canvas, and partly on their just relation to one\n",
      "another.  Ruskin says in his _Elements of Drawing_, from which I have\n",
      "already quoted, 'You will not, in Turner's largest oil pictures,\n",
      "perhaps six or seven feet long by four or five high, find one spot of\n",
      "colour as large as a grain of wheat ungradated.'  But the gradations of\n",
      "Turner differ from those of the modern French school by being gently\n",
      "and almost imperceptibly evolved one from another instead of being\n",
      "bodily and even roughly separated; and the brush of Turner followed the\n",
      "form of the objects he depicted, while our French friends often seem to\n",

      "blank wall of a house, which he had made instinct with the most\n",
      "delicate lights and colours.  Now I often amuse myself when I am\n",
      "looking at a wall or a flat surface of any kind by trying to\n",
      "distinguish all the different colours and tints which can be discerned\n",
      "upon it, and considering whether these arise from reflections or from\n",
      "natural hue.  You would be astonished the first time you tried this to\n",
      "see how many and what beautiful colours there are even in the most\n",
      "commonplace objects, and the more carefully and frequently you look the\n",
      "more variations do you perceive.\n",
      "\n",
      "But these are no reasons for limiting oneself to the plainest and most\n",
      "ordinary objects and scenes.  Mere prettiness of scene, to be sure, is\n",
      "not needed for a beautiful picture.  In fact, artificially-made pretty\n",
      "places are very often a hindrance to a good picture.  Nature will\n",
      "hardly stand a double process of beautification: one layer of idealism\n",
      "on top of another is too much of a good thing.  But a vivid scene, a\n",
      "brilliant atmosphere, novel and charming lights, impressive contrasts,\n",
      "if they strike the eye all at once, arouse an interest and an ardour\n",
      "which will certainly be reflected in the work which you try to do, and\n",
      "will make it seem easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be interesting if some real authority investigated carefully\n",
      "the part which memory plays in painting.  We look at the object with an\n",
      "intent regard, then at the palette, and thirdly at the canvas.  The\n",
      "canvas receives a message dispatched usually a few seconds before from\n",
      "the natural object.  But it has come through a post-office _en route_.\n",
      "It has been transmitted in code.  It has been turned from light into\n",
      "paint.  It reaches the canvas a cryptogram.  Not until it has been\n",
      "placed in its correct relation to everything else that is on the canvas\n",
      "can it be deciphered, is its meaning apparent, is it translated once\n",
      "again from mere pigment into light.  And the light this time is not of\n",
      "Nature but of Art.  The whole of this considerable process is carried\n",
      "through on the wings or the wheels of memory.  In most cases we think\n",
      "it is the wings--airy and quick like a butterfly from flower to flower.\n",
      "But all heavy traffic and all that has to go a long journey must travel\n",
      "on wheels.\n",
      "\n",
      "In painting in the open air the sequence of actions is so rapid that\n",
      "the process of translation into and out of pigment may seem to be\n",
      "unconscious.  But all the greatest landscapes have been painted\n",
      "indoors, and often long after the first impressions were gathered.  In\n",
      "a dim cellar the Dutch or Italian master recreated the gleaming ice of\n",
      "a Netherlands carnival or the lustrous sunshine of Venice or the\n",
      "Campagna.  Here, then, is required a formidable memory of the visual\n",
      "kind.  Not only do we develop our powers of observation, but also those\n",
      "of carrying the record--of carrying it through an extraneous medium and\n",
      "of reproducing it, hours, days, or even months after the scene has\n",
      "vanished or the sunlight died.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was told by a friend that when Whistler guided a school in Paris he\n",
      "made his pupils observe their model on the ground floor, and then run\n",
      "upstairs and paint their picture piece by piece on the floor above.  As\n",
      "they became more proficient, he put their easels up a storey higher,\n",
      "till at last the elite were scampering with their decision up six\n",
      "flights into the attic--praying it would not evaporate on the way.\n",
      "This is, perhaps, only a tale.  But it shows effectively of what\n",
      "enormous importance a trained, accurate, retentive memory must be to an\n",
      "artist; and conversely what a useful exercise painting may be for the\n",
      "development of an accurate and retentive memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no better exercise for the would-be artist than to study and\n",
      "devour a picture, and then, without looking at it again, to attempt the\n",
      "next day to reproduce it.  Nothing can more exactly measure the\n",
      "progress both of observation and memory.  It is still harder to compose\n",
      "out of many separate, well-retained impressions, aided though they be\n",
      "by sketches and colour notes, a new, complete conception.  But this is\n",
      "the only way in which great landscapes have been painted--or can be\n",
      "painted.  The size of the canvas alone precludes its being handled out\n",
      "of doors.  The fleeting light imposes a rigid time-limit.  The same\n",
      "light never returns.  One cannot go back day after day without the\n",
      "picture getting stale.  The painter must choose between a rapid\n",
      "impression, fresh and warm and living, but probably deserving only of a\n",
      "short life, and the cold, profound, intense effort of memory,\n",
      "knowledge, and will-power, prolonged perhaps for weeks, from which a\n",
      "masterpiece can alone result.  It is much better not to fret too much\n",
      "about the latter.  Leave to the masters of art trained by a lifetime of\n",
      "devotion the wonderful process of picture-building and\n",
      "picture-creation.  Go out into the sunlight and be happy with what you\n",
      "see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Painting is complete as a distraction.  I know of nothing which,\n",
      "without exhausting the body, more entirely absorbs the mind.  Whatever\n",
      "the worries of the hour or the threats of the future, once the picture\n",
      "has begun to flow along, there is no room for them in the mental\n",
      "screen.  They pass out into shadow and darkness.  All one's mental\n",
      "light, such as it is, becomes concentrated on the task.  Time stands\n",
      "respectfully aside, and it is only after many hesitations that luncheon\n",
      "knocks gruffly at the door.  When I have had to stand up on parade, or\n",
      "even, I regret to say, in church, for half an hour at a time, I have\n",
      "always felt that the erect position is not natural to man, has only\n",
      "been painfully acquired, and is only with fatigue and difficulty\n",
      "maintained.  But no one who is fond of painting finds the slightest\n",
      "inconvenience, as long as the interest holds, in standing to paint for\n",
      "three or four hours at a stretch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, let me say a word on painting as a spur to travel.  There is\n",
      "really nothing like it.  Every day and all day is provided with its\n",
      "expedition and its occupation--cheap, attainable, innocent, absorbing,\n",
      "recuperative.  The vain racket of the tourist gives place to the calm\n",
      "enjoyment of the philosopher, intensified by an enthralling sense of\n",
      "action and endeavour.  Every country where the sun shines and every\n",
      "district in it, has a theme of its own.  The lights, the atmosphere,\n",
      "the aspect, the spirit, are all different; but each has its native\n",
      "charm.  Even if you are only a poor painter you can feel the influence\n",
      "of the scene, guiding your brush, selecting the tubes you squeeze on to\n",
      "the palette.  Even if you cannot portray it as you see it, you feel it,\n",
      "you know it, and you admire it for ever.  When people rush about Europe\n",
      "in the train from one glittering centre of work or pleasure to another,\n",
      "passing--at enormous expense--through a series of mammoth hotels and\n",
      "blatant carnivals, they little know what they are missing, and how\n",
      "cheaply priceless things can be obtained.  The painter wanders and\n",
      "loiters contentedly from place to place, always on the look out for\n",
      "some brilliant butterfly of a picture which can be caught and set up\n",
      "and carried safely home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I am learning to like painting even on dull days.  But in my hot\n",
      "youth I demanded sunshine.  Sir William Orpen advised me to visit\n",
      "Avignon on account of its wonderful light, and certainly there is no\n",
      "more delightful centre for a would-be painter's activities: then Egypt,\n",
      "fierce and brilliant, presenting in infinite variety the single triplex\n",
      "theme of the Nile, the desert, and the sun; or Palestine, a land of\n",
      "rare beauty--the beauty of the turquoise and the opal--which well\n",
      "deserves the attention of some real artist, and has never been\n",
      "portrayed to the extent that is its due.  And what of India?  Who has\n",
      "ever interpreted its lurid splendours?  But after all, if only the sun\n",
      "will shine, one does not need to go beyond one's own country.  There is\n",
      "nothing more intense than the burnished steel and gold of a Highland\n",
      "stream; and at the beginning and close of almost every day the Thames\n",
